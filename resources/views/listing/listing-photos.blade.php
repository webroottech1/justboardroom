                    <br>
                    <p class="sub-title"><b>1. Perspective is key.</b> Shoot from the corners to get as wide an
                        angle as possible and make your room feel larger.
                        Change height levels and don’t be afraid to experiment with dramatic shots from low and high
                        angles. </p>
                    <p class="sub-title"><b>2. Light it up.</b> Well-lit boardrooms are always in high demand, so
                        capture as much light as possible. Natural light
                        is always better than fluorescent, so if your space has windows, make sure to include them in
                        the photos. </p>
                    <p class="sub-title"><b>3. Straight lines.</b> The frame of your photo should run parallel to
                        important vertical and horizontal lines in the shot,
                        like windows, desks, and ceiling lines. We recommend horizontal photos. </p>
                    <p class="sub-title"><b>4. Edit like a pro.</b> Take advantage of the edit options on your
                        phone to add a touch of saturation and sharpness, or
                        easily lower the warmth on rooms with incandescent light to quickly reduce that ‘orange look.’
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-title"><b>5. Tap away dark areas.</b> Shooting against windows can be tough
                        because it makes the whole room look dark. Take care
                        of this by tapping your phone on the dark part of the room. This will let the window overexpose
                        and lighten everything up, otherwise the room will be completely black.</p>
